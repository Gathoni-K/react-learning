 ****Arrays or Lists
-To display every item, we need to loop through our data.
-We use the .map() function.
Syntax: arrayName.map(callback function)


****Objects
-Objects cannot be rendered directly.
-To acces the properties of an object, access using, objectName.attribute


-All these have to be rendered in a list that must have a key, the name of the key is usualyy the singular form of our array or object name.
-The .map() function is always important.



****Components
1. Create our data array.
2.Create our individual component, the one that is to be repeated.
-No import is needed here, just export the function as usual.
3.Create our container component that maps-Our OG.
-Always add a unique key, key={}, then pass our data as props, e.g name={item.name}
-Import our individual component.
-Export our container component.
4.Use the container component in our app.
-Import our container component

-To render components, is basically returning them in a self-closing tag in our App.jsx after importing them.



****Conditional Rendering.
-This is the showing or hiding entire components based on certain conditions.
-It is deciding whether to render a whole component or not.
-Shows component if condition is true or not.
-Basically controlling the flow of which components appear based on my app's state or props.
-Use an if statement.



****Conditional Rendering Using Element Variables.
-Helps us avoid using 2 return statements on a single component.
-It is a good practice to only have one 'return'  statement in each component.

Syntax:
let varName = elements,
    e.g.
let message = <h1>I'm just a girl</h1>

**Remember to declare our variable without assigning any value to it, this is done before our 'if'
statement. i.e. 
            "let message;"


****Conditional Rendering using Ternary Operators.
Syntax: condition ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse;
E.g:
"
let isHappy = true;
let message = isHappy ? "I am Happy" : "I am not happy"
"
-Checks if 'isHappy' is true and will print the first condition.
- To render components instead, the syntax remains the same:
"
const display = false;
{
    return display ? <Component1/> : <Component2/>
}
"



****Conditionally rendering List items
- Used when wanting to isolate items from a list.


****Conditionally rendering a UI.
1.Ternary operator:
{condition ? <ElementToShow> : <AlternativeElement>}
-used when one wants to choose between showing one thing or another.
2.Logical and:
{condition && <element>}
-used when one wants to show something conditionally.
"Show this or nothing"
