-State is required because props are immutable and there are values that 
can change dynamically.
-Is an object that holds data related to a specific component.
-Object holding information to control behaviour of a component.
-The necessary information that has to be remembered throughout the app's lifecycle.

****PROPS VS STATE.
1.Props are passed to the component.
-State is contained inside the component.
2.Props are immutable.
-State can be changed.
3.Props are like parameters passed to a function.
-State is like a variable declared in function body.
4.Props provide external data to a component.
-State provide internal data to a specific component.

-To create a state, write your code before the jsx in your component.
Syntax:
    const[stateVariable, functionToChangeTheValue] = useState();
    //the function will set the value for count.
    //in the brackets in our state hook, we can set what we want our initial value for our variable to be.
            useState(0);
            //sets the initial value of count to 0.

-Pattern followed when controlling these states:
1.define the states.
2.Write functions that handle the state changes.
3.Call those functions in our jsx.

-The state of the component is declared at the beginning of the component.

-In every component where state is used, we need to import 'useState' as it is a React hook.
-To do this, at the start of your component, write:
        'import { useState } from "react"; '

-Our first hook being 'useState'.
-Hooks are special functions that are only available while React is rendering.
-Must be called at the top level of our components.
-When using it, it is our way of telling React that we want a component to remember something.
                const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
        //in this case, we want React to remember 'index'.
-The general convention is:
        const [something, setSomething]

-Is local to a component instance on the screen;
If the same component is rendered twice, each copy will have a completely isolated state.

****CREATING MULTIPLE STATES.
-Can be as many as needed in a component.
-It is advisable to have multiple state variables if their state is unrelated

-Events are necessary for React to be able to update its content.
-Different elements have different events:
        /*
        // Button clicks
<button onClick={increment}>+</button>

// Typing in inputs  
<input onChange={handleTextChange} />

// Form submissions
<form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>

// Mouse hover
<div onMouseOver={handleHover}>

// Checkbox clicks
<input type="checkbox" onChange={handleCheck} />
*/

-Handler functions are exactly what we use with our events.
-Are for responding to user events.
-Are caled 'handler' because they handle what happens when an event occurs.
-They normally:
-extract data from the event.
-update state.
-handle different input types.

Universal Handler Pattern:
const handleChange = (e) => {
        const { name, value, type, checked } = e.target;
        //How do you update state
} 
-Pattern used when:
-form has multiple inputs.
-all inputs update the same state object.
-need to reduce code duplication.

**Questions to guide handler writing:
1.Single or multiple inputs?
-single : 'setValue(e.target.value)'
-multiple : need to use 'name' attribute and computed property names.
2.What types of inputs are being handled:
-text: use 'value'
-checkbox: use 'checked'
-radio : use 'value'
3.Am I updating an object or a simple value?

**The 'name' attribute on my input should match the property name in my state object.
