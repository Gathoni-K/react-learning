-Is the basic building block of our application.
-Can be nested inside one another.
-A component can be made of multiple other smaller components.
-Names must always end with '.jsx'
-It is simply a JS function that returns jsx.

"App.jsx" contains an example of a component.

Syntax: 
function Componentname() {
    //js code here
    //code must always return 'jsx'.
    //what looks like HTML.
}

-The difference between jsx and HTML is the 'className' attribute unique to jsx only.

-In the 'src' folder, create a 'components' folder where all our components will go.
-Component names must always start with a capital letter.
-Our component should have the same name as our file.

-To actually use our component:
1. Import if in our main component using "import Createdcomponent from ("./components/CreatedCcomponent)"
2.Then in our created component, export it, after our function using "export default Createdcomponent"
3.Then to 'call it', in our main component "<Createdcomponent/>"


**REMEMBER:
-Component names should always start with capital letters to differentiate them from HTML tags.



-To export them, use:
export default function ComponentName() {
    //code goes here
}
-In our main app, 
import ComponentName from './components/ComponentName';
function App () {
    return (
        <div className = "App">

        <ComponentName />
        
        </div>
    )
}



-Importing data from one component to another:
-Define data at the lowest possible level that can still reach all the components that need it.
        -If only BookList needs book data → define in BookList
        -If BookList AND BookCounter need it → define in their shared parent
-The shared parent is one that contains both components, making them sibling components.
        -If the whole app needs it → define in App.jsx
1.Passing data from Parent to Child.
-Use props, allow us to pass information from parent component to its child component.
-
2.Passing data from Child to Parent component.
-Used to pass data from child component to parent.
-This is achieved by passing a callback function from parent to its child.



-Important to note that data flows down through parents, like a family tree.
-Simplest case:

//1.Parent holds data.
function Parent() {
    const data = [...];

//2.Passes data to children.
return (
    <div>
    <ChildA data = {data} />
    <ChildB data = {data} />
    </div>
);
}
//3.Children receive and use.
function ChildA({ data }){
    return <div>{/* use data */}</div>
}


-Render the giver component not the receiver.
-The giver is the one that has data and shares it.
-The receiver simply displays what it received
