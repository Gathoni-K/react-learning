-Props are to components as parameters are to functions, literally just variables for our component.
-Are a means of passing data into our component.
-To pass our props, we pass when we 'call' our component.
-Are capable of managing state.
-The flow of data in React is unidirectional; props can onle=y be passed from parent components down to its child.
Syntax:
" prop= 'value' "
-This is done in our 'App.jsx' where we call our component, so it looks something like this:
<ComponentName prop1="value" prop2="value" />

-In our component, pass the props as parameters.
Syntax:
export default function ComponentName ({prop1, prop2}) {}

So how do we do that?
-Pass our props the same way we assign classes in out HTML.
-use ''

-To access props, enter our variable name and enclose it within curly braces.
-One cannot directly access an object.
-Many props can be passed.

-Data passed to our component, so that it can be dynamic.
-Our React application is rendered twice, in our "main.jsx", our app runs in '.StrictMode', for debugging purpose, is removed when launching our apps.


***Destructuring props.
-Taking out values separately from an object without having to access them.
-all we have to do is store our 'attributes' in our props parameters
Syntax:
const {attribute1, attribute2} = props;
-This is if 'props' had been defined as our parameter.
-We can also pass our props directly as parameters if we enclose them in curly braces.
-and to call them, still wrap them within curly braces.


***Immutability of Props.
-Data cannot be changed.
-new values cannot be assigned to our props after declaring them in our main.jsx
-They are read-only.


*****Passing arrays and objects to components using props
-Declare our array in our app, store it in a variable, then to use it, 
go to the main app and try to access your variable.
-Access it the same way you access every other variable.
-This works for arrays

-What of objects?
-Declare the object in our app, and then in our main.jsx, you will access it using:
props.objectName.attribute
-To destructure our object, we can pass in our objectName as a parameter in our main.jsx.
-One will access the properties in this case using: objectName.attribute
