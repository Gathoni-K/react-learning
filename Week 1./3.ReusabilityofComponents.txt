-Break down UI into smaller components.
-Mixing components makes our application modular.
-Managing such applications becomes easier.
-Our components can be used anywhere in our code as many times as required.
-Separate components allows for proper testing, ensuring that each works correctly, making our application error-free.
-Abstraction is also a reason, hiding all the details of our application.
        -Hides the complexity of our code.

-simply define the component once then you can 'call' it as many times as required in our app.
-Make our components dynamic using props.
