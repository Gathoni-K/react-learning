-React apps are made out of components.
-A compnent is a piece of the UI that has its own logic and appearance
-It can be as small as a button or as large as an entire page.
-They are JS functions that return markup.
-They start with a capital letter and that is how you can differentiate them from HTML tags
that are always in lowercase.

-Specifying a CSS class is done by the use of 'className', which works the same as the HTML 
'class' attribute.

-Remember that on passing the props to our function, store them in curly braces.
-Our JSX starts from the 'return' statement.


****CLOSING TAGS IN OUR COMPONENTS.
-When rendering our components in our 'App.jsx', we normally use self-closing tags i.e.:
        <BookList/>
-However, one can also use both opening and closing tags, 
        <BookList></BookList>
-The second option is mostly used when the component will have children.
-Likely cases for a component to have children:
1.List/Container components; <Container></Container>
2.Layout components; <Modal></Modal>
3.Wrapper/Provider components; <AuthProvider></AuthProvider>

-The common method is using the first option, there is no difference as both syntaxes are equally
valid.


****NAMING CONVENTIONS.
-Components must use PascalCase, the component file and the function name should be the same and both in PascalCase.
-This is because React treats PascalCase as components and camelCase as regular HTML elements.
-Best practice is to match the file name to the component name: BookList.jsx contains function BookList()
-Variables or functions use camelCase: const bookCount = 3;
-Constants are written in 'UPPER_SNAKE_CASE': const MAX_BOOKS = 100;
-Props like variables also use camelCase.


****When setting up a React app, there are some files that are unecessary and are thus deleted.
-These files include: the public folder, the 'App.css' and 'index.css', the assets folder located in the src folder.
-Remove the deleted imports from the rest of our files.
-Then in our 'App.jsx', delete everything leaving only the function and the main div.
