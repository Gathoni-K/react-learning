-There are four ways of styling a React application:
1. Inline styling.
-Styling individual alements.
2. Using CSS stylesheets.
-Have a single CSS file where the styles have been defined in classes, the styles apply ro every single iput field.
3. CSS modules.
-Similar to approach number 2, but every single component has it's own CSS file.
4. Using libraries like Tailwind.

1.
-On defining the HTML elements, add styles directly to the elements.
-Use the style attribute in your elements then '{{}}' within the curly braces, write your styles.
-Syntax:
        <element style={{attribute1: property1, attribute2: property2}}></element>
        <h1 style={{color: blue}}>Inline Styling</h1>
-Define attributes with two names in camelCase: 'fontSize'.
-The outer curly braces are for writing js code, and the inner ones are for defining an object containing our styles.
-We can also define the object before our main function, the object contains all the syles and will be called in our elements.
-Syntax: 
        const objectStyle = { style1: "attribute", style2: "attribute"}

        //in our element
        <element style = {objectStyle}></element>


2.
-Inside our 'src' folder, create a folder for the css stylesheet.
-Inside our css file, write the CSS like you normally would.
-How do we make it such that our components are able to access these properties?
-Navigate to the css folder, usually the pattern would look something like/;
        import "../css/style.css";
-Move to our HTML element and define the class name in camelCase.
        <element className = "classDefinedInCssStylesheet" ></element>
-An advantgae is that multiple classes can be defined in a single file give the classes to the elements.
-The disadvantage of this is needing to come up with too many class names to style different elements differently.
-Not sustainable for huge projects.


3.
-Solves the problem with classes from the second solution.
-Create a module for every single component we have.
-Create a module by creating a file inside the components folder.
-File name system:
        componentToStyle.module.css
