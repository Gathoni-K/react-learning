******    How a React App Works            ********
-Are single-paged applications, there is only 1 html file.
-React creates specific elements for us.
-In the 'src' folder, there is the "main.jsx" which is the starting point of our app.
-Our "app.jsx" powers our entire webpage.
-To clear our webpage, go to the "app.jsx" and delete everything leaving only the block of code below:
          "
            import { useState } from 'react'
            import reactLogo from './assets/react.svg'
            import './App.css'

            function App() {
              const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

              return (
                <div className="App">
                </div>
              )
            }

            export default App
           "

"vite.config.js" - runs our vite app.
"package.json" - contains all the dependencies of our app.
"main.jsx" - selects root element from HTML page and renders React component.
"assets" - folder is useless, so is the "vite.svg"
"node_modules" - contains all the modules that we need to run our app.
