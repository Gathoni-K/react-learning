****File where I break down my app and note down things as I move along.

1.Think in components.
-Split UI into small, reusable components.
-Parent hold state, children receive props.

2.State = Data that changes.

3.Props = How components talk.
-Are like parameters to functions.

4.Event bubbles up.
-child says 'something happened' by calling a function it got from props.


***To implement a UI in React:
1.Break the UI into a component hierarchy.
-split up a  design into components in different ways:
Programming, a component should ideally do one thing.
CSS, consider what one would make class selectors for.
Design, consider how to organize design's layers.
-Components appearing within another component in the mockup should appear as a child in the hierarchy.
-One can either build 'top down' by starting with the components higher up in the hierarchy, or 'bottom up' by working
from components lower down, is easier to go bottom-up for large projects.


***Rember to import our css module files in the components they are to be used.
Then to reference them, give the 'className' attribute then;
        <element className={styles.classNameGivenToElement}> </element>


***Adding background pictures.
-Is kept in the 'public' folder of our app.
-Use an absolute path starting with '/' to access it.


****COMPLETE BREAKDOWN OF COMPONENTS WE HAVE IN OUR APP.
ToDo - parent component responsible for managing state.
Header - contains our title only.
Input - component responsible for capturing user input.
TaskList - component where all our tasks are displayed as a list, will be the container containing 
all our tasks.
TaskItem - component storing our individual task items, each task with its own delete button.


Input - state defined? Yes yes.

TaskItem - will receive the input from our Input component, will be passed as props then our task rendered in our TaskList component.
